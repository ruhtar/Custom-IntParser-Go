# Go String to Integer Parser ðŸ”¢

This is a Go parser that converts a string into an integer without using any of Go's native functions or libraries.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to manually parse a string representation of a number and convert it to an integer in Go. The approach avoids using any of Go's built-in conversion functions or external libraries, relying solely on byte manipulation.

## How It Works

1. **String to Byte Array Conversion**: The input string is first converted to a byte array with each element representing each character of the initial string.
2. **Byte Array to Integer Conversion**: Each byte representing a digit is converted to its numerical value by subtracting the ASCII value of '0'. The result is accumulated to form the final integer.
